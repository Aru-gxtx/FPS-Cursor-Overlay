# FPS-Cursor-Overlay

I wanted to improve my aim accuracy for headshots in FPS games by using a custom image, such as a person's face, as my cursor.

However, most dedicated cursor customization applications (such as Cursor Engine sold on Steam) are paid. Therefore, I created this Python script as a free and simple alternative. This script overlays the selected image onto the screen and makes the image follow the mouse movement, effectively functioning as a custom cursor.
