# FPS-Cursor-Overlay

I wanted to improve my aim accuracy for headshots in FPS games by using a custom image, such as a person's face, as my cursor.

However, most dedicated cursor customization applications (such as [Cursor Engine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201210/Cursor_Engine) sold on Steam) are paid. Therefore, I created this Python script as a free and simple alternative. This script overlays the selected image onto the screen and makes the image follow the mouse movement, effectively functioning as a custom cursor.


## Features

* Overlays an Image to the center of the screen, acting as a cursor
* Image is unaffected and clicks pass through the image


## Installation

This application is only available for Windows for now. For installation, you can just download the [fps_cursor_overlay.exe](https://github.com/Aru-gxtx/FPS-Cursor-Overlay/releases) file from the release section.
